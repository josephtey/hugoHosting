#### Connect charts to React Frontend

1. Make sure you have the default **Invoke URL** copied into your clipboard from API Gateway, then goto your cloud 9.

2. In frontend/src/Components/Charts.js, on line 7 substitute **REPLACE ME** with the invoke URL.

3. Test the app. To test the charts feature, goto the gallery page. If you have some images in the gallery the charts at the bottom should be populated with smile and age metrics. For example if you upload a 20 year old person smilling then you should have one unit for smilling and one unit for 20-39 year old on the charts.
