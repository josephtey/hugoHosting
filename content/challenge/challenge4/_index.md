#### Connect charts to React Frontend

1. Make sure you have the default **Invoke URL** copied into your clipboard from API Gateway, then go to your cloud 9.

2. In frontend/src/Components/Charts.js, on line 7 substitute **REPLACE ME** with the invoke URL.

3. Test the app. To test the charts feature, go to the gallery page. If you have some images in the gallery the charts at the bottom should be populated with smile and age metrics. For example, if you upload a 20-year-old person smiling then you should have one unit for smiling and one unit for 20-39-year-old on the charts.
